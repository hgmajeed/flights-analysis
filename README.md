# flights-analysis
### Analysis on 2008 USA Flights
This is the final project required by Udacity for graduation. The main goal of this project was to practice exploratory and explanatory data analysis. In this project, I wanted to identify the factors that affected the arrival delay of 2008 flights.  

## Python Version
- Python 3.7.3

## Required Library
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- time

## Dataset
The data set, `2008.csv` is a one large file with 7,009,728 rows and 29 columns. It was provided by the instructor.
_Since the file is too large, github failed to upload it. I will try later to use Git large File Storage to upload it_

## Other Files Provided
- `eda.ipynb`: This is the python file where I made all data wrangling and analysis.
- `eda.html`: This is the html version of the file above.
- `slide_show.ipynb`: This is a jupyter notebook to create the slide show.
- `slide_show_slides.html`: This is an html file to show the slide decks of the project.
