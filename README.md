## Required Library
- pandas
- numpy

## Dataset
The data set, `2008.csv` is a one large file with 7,009,728 rows and 29 columns. It was provided by the instructor. 

## Other Files Provided

- `eda.html`: This is the html version of the file above.
- `slide_show.ipynb`: This is a jupyter notebook to create the slide show.
